                    I have undertaken a number of projects since I started programming, which I have showcased on this page.
                    Some of these projects were a required part of Software Engineering courses,
                    and some I have done in my free time.

                            At my Datacom internship over Summer '17/'18 I gained a lot of exposure to modern web development tools and workflows.
                            All this new information made me question why I built this website (the one you're on) the way I did. I am currently working
                            on a new website, making it more professional than personal, and focusing on using modern tools to improve the development process
                            and ensure my web development skills are up to date with the ever changing industry.
                            <br /><br />
                            I am planning on using:
                            <br /><br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Webpack - so I can separate my JS files during development but deploy a single script.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bootstrap - for responsiveness.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    React.js - seems to be the best front-end framework for this site's purposes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Gulp - for running build tasks. Allows me to separate concerns during development more easily.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong><em>This</em></strong> site will stay live and I will use it for more personal and/or fun content like my piano videos, and web apps.

                            T&#257;tai! was a project that all part II Software Engineers had to complete in groups of two.
                            We were given a short project brief detailing the main functionality required, and were left to build the
                            application as we saw fit. Having no skeleton code, we had to think very carefully about the overall system design
                            and how we would coordinate our code. We decided our target users were to be young M&#257;ori children, who would be
                            using the app to improve their basic maths.

                            This was my first experience programming in a team, and consequently I learnt a lot from this project.

                            One of my friends found an old car phone and thought it would be cool to program it using an Arduino,
                            and use it as a sort of control panel in the car. For example it might display the current temperature and
                            could control some of the car's electronics. My friend is relatively comfortable with the electrical side of things, and
                            approached me to help with the programming part. This project is really ambitious but will probably be one of the most rewarding
                            among the list of projects here.

                        <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                            I've always wanted to work on a project that in some way helps my piano channel - Datty Plays. The natural way to combine
                            a programming project with piano is to make use of MIDI files, which are a digital representation of a musical performance. I am currently
                            familiarising myself with the MIDI file format, which is essential to understand before I can do anything with MIDI.
                            My end goal is to produce software that will automatically generate a visualisation of the MIDI performance.

                            <br />
                            This project is heavily inspired by the <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/smalin">smalin</a> YouTube channel.

                            There isn't much to say here, you're already looking at it! I'm essentially using this
                            as an ongoing project to teach myself web development skills. The website is fully responsive thanks to
                            Bootstrap, and some pages render live data by making API calls. For example, the view counts on my piano
                            videos are real data from the YouTube api.

                            This is one of my more ambitious ongoing projects. What I am aiming for is a GUI application that
                            simulates the board game Cluedo, with reasonable AI players, or even other online players. So far
                            I have managed to build a basic command line version of the app.

                            This one isn't very exciting. I implemented a bunch of sorting algorithms that we had been taught in class.
                            It was really just a small project to help my understanding of data structures.
