                    I have undertaken a number of projects since I started programming, which I have showcased on this page.
                    Some of these projects were a required part of Software Engineering courses,
                    and some I have done in my free time.

                        <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
                            T&#257;tai! was a project that all part II Software Engineers had to complete in groups of two.
                            We were given a short project brief detailing the main functionality required, and were left to build the
                            application as we saw fit. Having no skeleton code, we had to think very carefully about the overall system design
                            and how we would coordinate our code. We decided our target users were to be young M&#257;ori children, who would be
                            using the app to improve their basic maths.

                            This was my first experience programming in a team, and consequently I learnt a lot from this project.

                            This one isn't very exciting. I implemented a bunch of sorting algorithms that we had been taught in class.
                            It was really just a small project to help my understanding of data structures.

                            I've always wanted to work on a project that in some way helps my piano channel - Datty Plays. The natural way to combine
                            a programming project with piano is to make use of MIDI files, which are a digital representation of a musical performance. I am currently
                            familiarising myself with the MIDI file format, which is essential to understand before I can do anything with MIDI.
                            My end goal is to produce software that will automatically generate a visualisation of the MIDI performance.

                            <br />
                            This project is heavily inspired by the <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/smalin">smalin</a> YouTube channel.

                            Some examples of what I want to achieve are shown in the images below:

                            There isn't much to say here, you're already looking at it! I'm essentially using this
                            as an ongoing project to teach myself web development skills. The website is fully responsive thanks to
                            Bootstrap, and some pages render live data by making API calls. For example, the view counts on my piano
                            videos are real data from the YouTube api.
